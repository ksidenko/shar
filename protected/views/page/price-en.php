<H1>Catalog of main concept:</H1>

<p><b>Design project</b> – the complex of documents, designed during planning work according to order of a client which maintain needs for construction and redecoration of the object.</p>

<p><b>Architectural supervision</b> – action plan which is brought in order to insure technological, stylistic and technical decisions with designated project.</p>

<H1>The gist of designing works:</H1>

<H2>Stage one. Building preparations:</H2>
<ul>
    <li>gathering and evaluation of the data, creation of work plan with a client (questioning, testing and private conversation);</li>
    <li>examination of distinctive features of future work object (visit of an object, observation and photo shoot);</li>
    <li>creation of a graphical representation with stand communications and architectural features;</li>
    <li>creation of future technical working plan with a client.</li>
</ul>

<H2>Stage two. Rough plan of an indoor scene.</H2>
<ul>
    <li>creation of different variants of planning (according to stand demands and prospective legislation);</li>
    <li>the selection from created variants of planning with disposal of functional zones;</li>
    <li>the selection of chosen variant of planning in color and in scale with selection of chosen elements of furniture and equipment;</li>
    <li>the pickup and coordination of main interior finish materials of floor, walls and ceiling with a client;</li>
    <li>the pickup and coordination of plumbing equipment and accessories with a client;</li>
    <li>the pickup and coordination of free-standing furniture for all rooms with a client according to fabric catalogs;</li>
    <li>coordination of build-in furniture with a client according to sketch designs;</li>
    <li>the pickup and coordination of lighting equipment with a client according to fabric catalogs;</li>
    <li>the pickup and coordination of doors with a client according to fabric catalogs;</li>
    <li>the creation of three-dimensional image of planning main zones, in order to present the clear image of color and interior decisions.</li>
</ul>

<H2>Stage 3. Development of designing process:</H2>
    Completion of the following planning:
<ul>
    <li>planning of apertures and dividing walls;</li>
    <li>planning of floor construction;</li>
    <li>planning of ceiling construction;</li>
    <li>planning of lightning equipment emplacement;</li>
    <li>planning of sources of light and their controllers emplacement;</li>
    <li>planning of electric accessories emplacement (sockets; light switchers;  phone, internet, video and house phone cables; TV cable, heat-insulated floor);</li>
    <li>planning of plumbing equipment emplacement;</li>
    <li>planning of air handling equipment and air conditioners emplacement;</li>
    <li>planning of furniture emplacement;</li>
    <li>planning of heat0insulated floors and heating devices emplacement;</li>
    <li>wall elevations with molding of possible materials;</li>
    <li>design of in-built furniture;</li>
    <li>specification of needed materials and equipment.</li>
</ul>

<H2>Stage 4. Author’s supervision and routine maintenance:</H2>
<ul>
    <li>Task description of calculations and decoration works to constructors;</li>
    <li>Author’s supervision of decoration works according to designed project; immediate decision making;</li>
    <li>Placement of orders: supply of home decoration materials; wiring, illumination, plumbing equipment; in-build and ready furniture;</li>
    <li>Works on interior decoration, selection and fabrication of window-blinds, selection of accessories joint with narrowly focused specialists.</li>
</ul>

<H1>Determination of the value of desing project</H1>
In each specific case the cost of designing works is taken into account individually and depends on the following criteria:
<ul>
    <li>total space of planned object;</li>
    <li>the location of the object;</li>
    <li>functions of planned object;</li>
    <li>presence of visualization.</li>
</ul>
